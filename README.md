# The Synthesis ToolKit in C++ (STK) Library for Arduino

# Overview

The [Synthesis ToolKit in C++ (STK)](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk/) is a set of open source audio
signal processing and algorithmic synthesis classes written in the C++
programming language. You can find further informarmation in the original [Readme of the STK Project](/STK.md)

Like many other sound libraries it originates from an University (Princeton) and can look back at a very long history: it was created in __1995__. In the 90s the computers had limited processor power and memory available. In todays world we
can get some cheap Microcontrollers, which provide almost the same capabilities.    

This project has been implemented as Arduino Library and runs on ESP32 processors.
